        <p>Would you like to earn a great income by sharing your home with a foster child?<br>
            Did you know you could earn a generous tax-free income, if you have a spare bedroom?<br>
            Fostering is a great way to earn and play a rewarding role in the life of a child <br>
            We offer many benefits, just one of which is full training, meaning you do not need to start out with any qualifications! We offer ongoing support and can put you in touch with other foster carers, so it is a great way to meet others and make new friends. <br>
            People just like you, from all walks of life, are already enjoying the benefits and rewards of becoming foster carers, but we need more!
            We need more people like you to join the growing number of foster families, to ensure we can offer the best care for the number of children and young adults requiring placement.<br>
            No matter, whether you are married or single, a same sex couple or are transgender, whatever your social or ethnic background, we need more foster carers like you to offer love, care and a home to support these children.<br>
            Your own children may have flown the nest or you may just love the noise that having a busier home can create.<br>
            Whatever your reason, even if you start out looking to find an income, you will certainly find a rewarding career waiting for you when you choose to become a foster carer
            Providing a child with a home until the time is right for them to move on through your care will change both your life and theirs.<br>
            If you have time available, are looking for a career change, or even looking for a new way to earn an income, maybe because of the COVID-19 pandemic, why not choose fostering?<br>
            Fostering offers a generous income through your offer of a spare room and care to a child or young adult in need of support, with minimum initial requirements.
            You have the opportunity through fostering to commence a rewarding career, with the benefit of helping your financial worries whilst doing so.<br>
            You will get full support through training and guidance and have the opportunity for extra support through the many other foster carers also looking to change the lives of our next generation with the love and support they offer.<br>
            Children and young adults would love to join your home, so if you feel that fostering could be your next great step and is right for you and your family, why not get in touch to find out more.</p>
